Chrome DevTools Theme: Flatland 
===========================

    This Project is DEPRECATED.

**As of 3.0.0, Chrome has updated all of the selectors to have a `html /deep/` selector, which is incompatible with sass. There will be no future maintenance on this project due to the inconsistency of the selectors.**

Unfortunately, this project is incredibly difficult to maintain as a passion project and with the amount of changes that Chrome makes in it's DevTools, maintaining just the proper selectors
has been hard.

IF you're interested in owning and maintaining this project going forward, please contact me and I'll be happy to pass ownership of both the github repo and the chrome webstore project. 

Notes:

If a new owner comes along, there are modifications from the last commit that were done in the flatland.css that will be missing from the sass files and will either need to be imported
to the sass files or the css file needs to become the main project file.
